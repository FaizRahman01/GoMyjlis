#  GoMyjlis ðŸ’»

"GoMyjlis" is my final year project, and it serves as a simplified event management system with a focus on small event functionalities. This project marks my first attempt at creating a project using Laravel, where I primarily concentrated on learning and implementing controllers and views. For retrieving data from the database, I extensively used Laravel's query builder. Despite the one-month development timeframe, I acknowledge that the project may not be perfect, but it provided me with valuable experience in utilizing Laravel for web development.
